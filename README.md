# Structured-Bond


"This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive case study involving the issuance of a structured bond by Bank XX on January 31, 2023, at 10:45 C.E.T. The study is conducted in a single-curve interest rate modeling setting, without considering counterparty risk. Market parameters for flat Cap Volatilities are provided in percentage values within an Excel spreadsheet. The primary objectives of this case study are as follows:

a. **Pricing (Determining Upfront and Spot Vols):**
   - Calculate the upfront cost (X%) for the structured bond.
   - Determine the spot volatilities.

b. **Risk Measure (Delta-Bucket Sensitivities):**
   - Compute Delta-bucket sensitivities to assess the risk associated with the structured bond.

c. **Total Vega Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total Vega, representing the sensitivity of the bond's value to changes in volatility.

d. **Portfolio Risk Management (Delta Hedge):**
   - Consider course-grained buckets (0-2y; 2y-5y; 5y-10y) and hedge the Delta risk by constructing a portfolio of interest rate swaps.
   - Determine the notionals for 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year swaps that result in zero bucket deltas in the hedged portfolio.

e. **Portfolio Risk Management (Vega Hedge):**
   - Hedge the Vega risk using an ATM 5-year Cap with a strike equal to the ATM 5-year Swap rate.
   - Continue to hedge the Delta risk as done in step (d).

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for financial practitioners and enthusiasts interested in structured bond pricing, risk management, and hedging strategies."
